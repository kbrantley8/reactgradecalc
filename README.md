# Kory's Grade Calculator in React

This was just a starter project for me to learn React for my junior design project in the Fall of 2019. This was created over the Summer of 2019 using bootstrap and jQuery. Also for the Fall of 2019, I joined the GaTech SGA IT Board and wanted to experiment with RESTful API's and Node.js so there are two branches here to use. The **master** branch is the main branch, that has just basic functionality of the website with basically no backend/database. The **databaseIntegration** branch is the branch where I began experimenting with Node.js and MySQL integration, but it's not functional yet.

## Information

There are two versions of this in the two branches: **master** and **databaseIntegration**.

## Installing

1) To install all the plugins needed for this app, run:

```
npm install
```

2) and then:

```
npm start
```

This should start up the server and you should be able to interact with it with no database.

If you want the **databaseIntegration**, do:

```
git fetch --all
```

then: 

```
git checkout databaseIntegration
```

That should be it. Hopefully that works lol. Thanks for checking this out! :-)
