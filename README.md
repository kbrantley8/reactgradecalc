# Kory's Grade Calculator in React

This was just a starter project for me to learn React for my junior design project in the Fall of 2019. This was created over the Summer of 2019 using bootstrap and jQuery. Also for the Fall of 2019, I joined the GaTech SGA IT Board and wanted to experiment with creating a backend that uses a database. So I added a backend to this project using Firebase that is universal. 

## Information

This was made for myself so the grades shown will be reflected among everybody who messes with it. Feel free to make your own course and play with it however you want but be aware that everyone will be able to see it.

## Installing

1) To install all the plugins needed for this app, run:

```
npm install
```

2) and then:

```
npm start
```

This should start up the server and you should be able to interact with it.

That should be it. Hopefully that works lol. Thanks for checking this out! :-)
